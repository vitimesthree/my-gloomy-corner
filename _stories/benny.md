# The Truth about Friday Night Funkin'

Have you ever missed a note in Friday Night Funkin' and wonder where it went?

Well, let me tell your the truth of Friday Night Funkin'.

## The theory

Boyfriend is not the Boyfriend you think he is, but is in fact a little boy named Benny. Benny was born without vocal chords, yet his one wish was to rap. Benny has a disease that makes him have blue hair and a short stature, which caused him to fall into a coma, which created the game Friday Night Funkin'.

This information is backed up by the fact all the weeks represent the 7 deadly sins.

Week 1 represents Greed.
Week 2 represents Lust.
Week 3 represents Gluttony.
Week 4 represents Envy.
I could go on all day. But, what if I told you, this game, isn't even fiction?

Ninjamuffin once visited a hospital for boys with the disease Benny has, and saw one of them with blue hair playing with a microphone. The boy's mother had the same disease as him, wearing a red dress, which was the inspiration for Girlfriend. Girlfriend's name is Nancy, her demonic nature comes from her committing violence upon her guardians. This is why she was adopted by Mommy Nearest and Daddy Dearest. Nancy saw her new parents as "devil", and ran away with Benny.

Ninjamuffin approached Benny, and asked the boy for his story, which he gladly told.

"I wish I could sing. That is my final wish. But if I can't fulfil this wish, I beg you to spread my story and help me sing."

Ninjamuffin nodded and patted the boy on the head, telling him he would create a game called Friday Night Funkin', with Boyfriend, Girlfriend, and alike. The boy coughed and smiled, as Ninjamuffin left the hospital. The boy awaited Ninjamuffin to return, but when the game became a hit, Ninjamuffin didn't help the boy, and instead left his treatment unpaid, causing the boy to die. The boy died, while Ninjamuffin became rich. He even repeated the offense, by putting two starving children in the game, but that's another story.

To make matters worse, once Ninjamuffin heard the boy's last meal was a lemon, he added the evil lemon character to the game. Upon revealing this character, everyone cheered, not knowing that the lemon was based on such a tragedy. But I do.

Sick, and, twisted.

## My reaction

Well, now you know the truth. I know that for one I can't look at this game the same way anymore.
